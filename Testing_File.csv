He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.

What this money would be used for is the associated costs of setting up our new home.  We have an apartment reserved for us, but we need to pay a deposit on it as well as possible deposits on utility services.  We will also need to buy groceries to restock the pantry and refrigerator.  In addition, there will be approximately a 3-week gap between when my paychecks from my old job end and when my first paycheck from my new position arrives.  That last &quot;old&quot; paycheck will pay the rent for the month, but not any of the other living expenses of the month.<br/><br/>Please consider helping us with our situation!

I would move the $4,500 in credit debt to that card which guarantees a 3% rate on balance transfers for 5 years.   I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.  And then because of the new zero balance on the bank line of credit the remainder of the vehicle loan could be transferred to that line of credit.

I have supported myself through college (still paying a little left) to get a degree in Criminal Justice, and have run into a tight time!  <br/><br/>I've been working two jobs for as long as I can remember, and recently got my full time job's hours cut almost in half due to financial strain within the franchise and my position is slowly being phased out.  Thankfully, I was able to pick up more hours at job #2 to cover bills, etc, but now I have to pay health insurance on my own since I am not full time at either job.  I have recently had a medical emergency, and accrued a little credit card debt trying to cover my regular monthly bills, health insurance, &amp; unexpected medical bills.  <br/><br/>I'm doing all I can, and have been doing great so far juggling this all alone, but I need to pay off the only credit card I have before it gets me in too deep.  I have moved in with my boyfriend who is not asking for a dime towards rent, utilities, or groceries so that I can put all my money and efforts towards getting these debts paid off quicker than ever.<br/><br/>It would be such a great relief and help to be able to do this!   I am and have always been a very responsible person financially, and know that with my dependable income (although coming from two separate places), it is within my budget to pay this loan off with no problem whatsoever. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for your time and consideration.<br/>",other,Jasmine,180xx,PA,16.8,0,01/01/2001,2,60,NA,9,0,1555,32.4,29,f,0,1,PC1

9333,Grayline of Seattle,1,RENT,24000,not verified,n,"Hello! I am a professional dancer who is undergoing a comprehensive Pilates Certification. I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.  Lindsey co-directs GoGoVertigoat Dance Project (www.gogovertigoat.org).

I obtained a BA in Information Systems and recently obtained a good paying job.  Other than hanging with my family I enjoy racing motocross with my son and working out.  Credit situation: Back in 2000 I filed for Chap. 7 Bankruptcy because I was young and not aware of how credit worked back then.  Since then I have been very responsible and have been  rebuilding my credit.  I have never been late on any payments.  Purpose of loan: The purpose of this loan will be to consolidate  2 outstanding loans that have interest rates of 25% and one credit card with a balance of $600.  Budget: I will be repaying this loan back with my paychecks each month.  Currently I bring home around $5200 per month.  My monthly expenses are around $4400, so paying this back will not be a problem.  I just want to lower my interest rate on my loan. Please see below for budget layout.

However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.

For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.   Thank you!",debt consolidation,Loan To Eliminate Credit Card Debt,335xx,FL,13.43,0,12/01/1991,0,NA,89,6,1,30497,93.8,14,f,0,3,PC4

I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.  By borrowing against my Pension I will receive the 7% interest being paid to above credit cards. I have excellent credit. I want to keep it that way.

9606,24 Hour Fitness,1,RENT,20000,not verified,n,"My name is Chris and I live in Austin, Texas.  I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve done since last December after getting out of school.  I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém a hard worker, and I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I don’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎét have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎéll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, I’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎém willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave Ramsey’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎés Financial Peace University course.  In case you’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎére not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where ’‘Î¢’Ç’_’Ç’every dollar is spent before the month begins.’‘Î¢’Ç’_’ÇÎ  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.

Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities.

We received 0% interest for the first 6 months, and have been paying $216 a month since June. The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan ""B"" was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan ""C"" is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan ""C"".  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job. I have been with my current employer for only 1 year and 7 months, but have been in the same industry for 12 years, with only one previous employer (in this industry).

More stringent rules &amp; regs were put in place to protect the financial intitutions. Ok fine, but how the honest, hard working folk, who have &amp; are trying so to hard to STAY in the game, nevermind GET AHEAD, supposed to do just that when no one gives us the chance? I've worked very hard for 8 years to bring myself back from a really hard time and have done VERY well for myself and have not faltered.  But unless youre credit score is in the 800's and have a 2nd income at home, banks just don't wanna talk to ya....Anyway, yes, the interest may be higher but I'm glad I found Lending Club, and the op to pre-pay w/out penalty exists if I am able in the future should my loan request fully fund! I have a goal - a strategy - 1 loan to pay off some debt w/ the much higher interest which will eventually facilitate looking for a house. A positive outlook and a little bit of faith go a looong way! I think it would be prudent to mention as well the &quot;initial loan&quot; imentioned was/in not w/ Lending Club.  Thought I would clarify.<br/> Borrower added on 08/07/11 > I just want to send out a truly heartfelt THANK YOU to each and every investor who has done so in an effort to help me work toward my goal.

Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd.

The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food.

9719,Deloitte and Touche,1,RENT,48000,not verified,n,"Hello Everyone!  LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in ""context"" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollarŠ—ç’_Îés ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who readŠ—ç’__ well I wonŠ—ç’_Îét digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

The cards collectively have just too high of interest rates to get anywhere with the payments I can make.  The payments are always above the minimum payment its just not enough.  I will of course plan on making larger than minimum payments to you as well. I plan on canceling a couple of them but not all of them because I heard that is bad for your credit.     I would really appreciate this loan because I would really like to be able to start enjoying my paycheck someday instead of just paying bills and maybe one day have good enough credit to purchase a home.

9876,Blue Water Powerboats Inc.,1,MORTGAGE,82800,not verified,n,"Purpose of loan: This loan will be used to purchase a new outboard motor for my biggest rental boat, a 26' center console.  This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.  The motor was under water for about an hour, and though we were able to get it running again, it wasn't completely saved. It appears something got tweaked inside when it got wet while running. This is a large center console fishing boat that is in demand on a daily basis.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I plan to use the money to continue to grow my small business.  I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.  I purchased this business last year, investing a good portion of my life savings as well as some home equity into it.  I have grown the revenue roughly 40% over the previous ownership, and I have become a one-stop-shop for everything fun related in conjunction with watersports.  In 10 months we have added 2 more boats and 2 waverunners, 4 kayaks, 3 surfboards, a banana boat, boogie boards, as well as other revenue generating equipment to the fleet.  I have developed working relationships with Hilton, Marriott, and various other resort companies here in South Florida, and I plan to begin an online reservation system and Franchise plan in the near future.  This extra capital will allow me to stretch a vital purchase out over time in order to not hinder further growth and progress of my small business.
